## Design

### Color Scheme
For color scheme, I took inspiration from the background image to generate a scheme that looked good. For this, I used [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/).<br>

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the typography.

For headings, I used [Limelight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Limelight?query=limelight). I choose this font because of it's simple but yet playful look.

For paragraphs, I used [Inter Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) since I wanted the font weight to match the Limelight font, yet be easy to read.
